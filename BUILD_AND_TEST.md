# Quick Build and Test Commands

## Angular Frontend

```bash
cd ameri-polytechnic
npm install
npm start
```

This runs `ng serve` and starts the development server (usually on http://localhost:4200).

## Laravel Backend

```bash
cd ameri-polytechnic-api
composer install
npm install
npm run dev
```

Or use Laravel's combined dev script:
```bash
cd ameri-polytechnic-api
composer dev
```

This runs Laravel server, queue, logs, and Vite all together.
